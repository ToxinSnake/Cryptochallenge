# Cryptochallenge

The goal was to crack an asymmetrically encrypted message. The encryption-scheme was the very unknown "Imai-Matsumoto Public-Key Cryptosystem C*" which was never uses in practice because it was broken very early on in 1998, although the German Federal Intelligence Service broke it three years earlier.

Only the encrypted message and public key were given.
